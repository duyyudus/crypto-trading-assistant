This project builds a **semi-automated trading assistant** that monitors Binance Spot markets and sends **Telegram alerts** when specific strategy conditions are met.  
It does **not execute trades** â€” it focuses on continuous data monitoring, signal detection, and timely human-readable alerts.

The system should be modular, easily extensible for new trading strategies, and simple to run locally or on a small server (e.g. WSL2, VPS, or Raspberry Pi).
